# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using KMeans Clustering

## 📊 Project Overview

This notebook applies the **KMeans clustering algorithm** to segment customers based on key features such as:

- **Age**
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score**

The dataset consists of 200 mall customers, and the aim is to identify distinct customer groups to assist in **targeted marketing strategies**.

## ⚙️ Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters
- KMeans clustering using **scikit-learn**
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

---

## 📈 Final Output

Includes scatter plots showing customer clusters and centroids to visualize how different customer groups behave.
